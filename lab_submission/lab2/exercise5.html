        <h1>Blockchain</h1>
        <p>A <strong>consensus digital ledger</strong> comprised of unchangeable, digitally recorded data in packages called blocks. Each block is ‘chained’ to the next block using a cryptographic signature. This allows blockchains to act like a ledger, which can be shared with and accessed by anyone with the appropriate permissions. <a href="https://consensys.net/knowledge-base/a-blockchain-glossary-for-beginners" target="_blank">Reference Website</a></p>
